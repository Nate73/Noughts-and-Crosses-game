In this game you must move the rows and columns so that the puzzle is in the form: XOX
                                                                                   OXO
                                                                                   XOX
To move the rows and columns, first input the column or row you would like to move then the direction you would like to move it using the number pad.
For example the input a2 would move the column a down.
